  I've removed the ServerSided AntiCheat, as if you're going to just do that, might as well make your game proper and entirely prevent exploits. Also because the ServerSided one would've been a smaller version of the one introduced in my games, so it wouldnt make sense to release it. 
  Also Id like to mention if you do want the server-sided version and I get enough support for it, I'll start developing it

<p align="center">
  Hello, everyone, I am Styx, representing Jupiter Development. While we've always delivered top-notch scripting in the open-source and public landscape, this time we're crossing into new territory with a project that's beneficial and provides a thrill of learning not just for you, but for me as well.

  <h2>The Why</h2>
  Our latest production introduces a clientsided Luau Anti-Cheat, marking a departure from our usual offerings. With our extensive experience, we're confident in delivering a robust system, minimizing false positives, and providing immense customization. Client-Sided Anti-Cheats, this is not rated for real-world application. This is a no longer in development anticheat, and is not backed, we will not be updating this. We are working on a newer Anti-Cheat that does things better. I recommend that FOR FULL USE IN GAMES.

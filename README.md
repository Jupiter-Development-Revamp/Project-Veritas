<p align="center">
  Hello, everyone, I am Styx, representing Jupiter Development. While we've always delivered top-notch scripting in the open-source and public landscape, this time we're crossing into new territory with a project that's beneficial and provides a thrill of learning not just for you, but for me as well.

  <h2>The Why</h2>
  Our latest production introduces a clientsided Luau Anti-Cheat, marking a departure from our usual offerings. With our extensive experience, we're confident in delivering a robust system, minimizing false positives, and providing immense customization. Client-Sided Anti-Cheats, rated for real-world application. We challenge the notion of "Never trust the client" and invite you to judge for yourselves.

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  This marks our first time venturing into the realm of real Anti-Cheat solutions, presenting a learning curve for us. Nevertheless, we hope this project will be educational and useful to all who encounter it. Its success is important to us, showcasing our competency in everything we tackle, even Anti-Cheat solutions.

<h2 align="center">What Are Our Plans?</h2>
  Leveraging our expertise in Luau, we're committed to ensuring the smooth progression of this project. We aim to elevate these Anti-Cheats to the level of their paid counterparts, all at the fingertips of anyone who sees this. We're proud to provide an anti-cheat solution we are confident in, all while remaining open-source as per our promise to the open-source communities. Although we acknowledge certain limitations due to our lack of experience in these fields.

<h3>Features</h3>
  While this is not done, we plan to add plenty of features; minimizing those pesky cheaters and encouraging fair gameplay. While there will be no ban system in place, you are more than allowed to add it; I plan to ensure customization at its core. Ranging from enacting a strike system, kick system, warnings, to even custom user interfaces for you to show the user their warned.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
  While typical Anti-Cheat systems that are free and open-source have plenty of false detections, I plan to minimize these with my experience in the Luau scripting language. With the skillset of Jupiter Development, we ensure efficient memory usage. Say goodbye to the old clunky and poorly scripted anti-cheat and say hello to the robust systems by Jupiter Development.
